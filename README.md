This is my project for the 2021 Code Louisville Python class. My application helps users find a new car based on their input. The app will display the results from Neil Huffman's website and export a csv file to the user's directory.

## Project Submission:
Submitted on 07/29/2021

## Features:
1. Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.
2. Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
3. Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code.
4. Implement a “scraper” that can be fed a type of file or URL and pull information off of it.
